# Table S1
Table S1: The detailed information of the 800 noncovalent NA-ligand complexes. Totally four columns were included in Table S1, namely pdbid, head, type and final_ligand_res_full. pdbid column stores the PDBID of complex; head column stores the HEADER information of complex PDB file; type column stores the receptor type of complex; final_ligand_res_full stores the final ligand information of complex, in a format of ‘name_chain_resid’.
